# MTG Deck Builder Analysis

## Epic:

As a MTG player, I want to be able to use filters and find card stats to help me build or improve my MTG deck, so that I can optimise my strategies and card choices.

## filtering

### User Story one

As a player, I want to search for cards by name or any text contained in the name(e.g., searching "Dragon" shows all Dragon cards), so that I can quickly locate specific cards or card families

### User story two

As a player, I want to filter the card list by selecting a colour (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green), so that I only see cards that fit the color identity of my deck.

### User Story three

As a player, I want to filter cards based on their primary type (e.g., Creature, Instant, Enchantment) and their subtypes (e.g., Goblin, Dragon, Aura), so that I can find specific utility or tribal cards.

### User Story four

As a player, I want to filter and range search cards based on their total Converted Mana Cost (CMC), so that I can manage my deck's mana curve.

## Analysis and Insights

### User Story five

As a player, I want to see a histogram of the card count aggregated by Converted Mana Cost (CMC), so that I can quickly assess the mana curve of the current filtered card set.

### User Story six

As a player, I want to see a breakdown of the number of cards for each colour and how much of each colour's mana is required in the costs, so that I can ensure a balanced mana base.

## User Story seven

As a player, I want to see a visual summary of the card primary types (Creature, Sorcery, Instant, etc.) in the filtered set, so that I can check the spell-to-permanent ratio of my deck.
